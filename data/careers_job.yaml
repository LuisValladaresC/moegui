      DevOps brings a collaborative approach to software development, testing and deployment. It puts small teams with varying objectives together to work toward more efficient and high-quality code releases. There cannot be any barriers between the different personas, making communication skills (both verbal and written) a necessity for a successful DevOps engineer.

      Engineers need to regularly speak with internal management teams involved in the DevOps process and stay familiar with the objectives, roadmap, blocking issues, and other project areas. Also, they need to communicate with customers around support issues effectively.

      Communication is critical, but so too is the ability to collaborate. DevOps engineers should be team players and support their colleagues throughout sprints or software iterations. This is about more than just being a good teammate â€” you should also have the skills to mentor and advise team members on the best ways to deliver code, what tools to use when coding, and how to test the latest features.

      - Performance tuning, task automation, and improving our continuous integration and deployment processes.

      - Actively participate in high-level team activities such as suggesting architecture improvements, recommending process improvements, and conducting tool evaluations. 
      - Identify and implement improvements to the platform and processes around release and maintenance. Conduct routine security and software updates.
      - Assist with the maintenance and monitoring of current systems infrastructure on an ongoing basis.
