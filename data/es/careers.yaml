  We strongly believe in collaboration teamwork. We provide all available state-of-the-art tools to work stressless and ensure that everyone is on the same page no matter what time zone lives. Pretty much all our work goes over GitLab and Google Workspace. Also, Confluence to enforce our communication.

  We offer Paid Vacations, Xmas break, and three leaves per quarter. You can apply for part-time or full-time, and that depends on your desired time to work. We do respect that because we want you happy and fresh.

  **Because we're a fully remote team â€” we hire people from all over the world!**
